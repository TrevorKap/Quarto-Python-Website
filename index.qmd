## Welcome!

This website is dedicated to my previous works in Python.  

Python has been an excellent tool for spatial and data visualizations, programming, and machine learning. Yet this site is only a fraction of the work I've done in the geospatial sciences atmosphere. 
One notable project using pythion was a [cluster analysis on Philadelphia's amenity landscape](https://luckylaharltim.github.io/MUSA_5500_Final/). The project was highlighted at [Wharton-Weitzman Future of Cities Conference 2024](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7161942272912125952/)

My other projects & experience can be found [on my Portfolio](https://trevorkap.github.io/Portfolio-Page/) or [on my Resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s20csw_YlE92LhpNQgCxYG2uqU3rsgzv/view).
